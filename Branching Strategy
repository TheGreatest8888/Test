**\-Branching Strategy-**
-------------------------

*   Branching strategy off of the protected default branch should be as follows:
    
    *   **feature-short-description-fdpetde-####** 
        
        *   This feature branch indicates that this is planned work (related to a specific user story, fdpetde-####) that a given engineer would be assigned or paired on. 
            
        *   Work in this feature branch would only scope to that of the Acceptance Criteria of the user story
            
        *   All other work should be handled in the form of a defect/hotfix for the repository
            
        *   Branch name will be all lowercase
            
        *   Branch name short-description should be a short, ideally a three word, description
            
        *   All words in branch name should be separated by hyphens
            
    *   **hotfix-short-description-fdpetde-####**
        
        *   Branching off of the default branch as well, this hotfix-\* branch would represent a defect or some sort of unplanned work that would need to happen and merged into master to move forward effectively. 
            
        *   The Draft PR would still be opened right at the beginning of this branch's lifecycle and work done in this branch should only reflect that of the description/AC for the defect (fdpetde-####) created in Jira
            
        *   Branch name will be all lowercase
            
        *   Branch name short-description should be a short, ideally a three word, description
            
        *   All words in branch name should be separated by hyphens
            
    *   Draft PR opened immediately after creating branch
        
        *   Assumes some Jenkins job is configurations such as: PRs are used instead of branches, etc.
            
            *   ToDo: list out Jenkins job configs all jobs should be set to
